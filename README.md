# MemDump version 1.0
Copyright (C) 2018 s0s

MemDump is a program written in intel 8088 assembly to display the contents of memory in hexadecimal on a 20 character wide x 4 line LCD screen. You can read the article about it on my techblog: http://www.techstuffonly.com/in-the-spirit-of-the-homebrew-computer-club-building-a-homebrew-8088-computer-part-2/

A future goal is to accept input from the user to determine what memory address to start at.

This code is written for NASM.

This program will only run on very specific hardware, with even more specific configurations. Right now, my homebrew 8088 computer is the only one it will run on, however I will release the schematics of the hardware soon, so that others will be able to build fully-compatible models.
