# memdump
Current version: MemDump 0.8.0 (Alpha release)

MemDump is a program written in intel 8088 assembly to display the contents of memory in hexadecimal on a 20 character wide x 4 line LCD screen. This is the first released version, and it's not officially a completed, finished release yet. This is in an experimental stage, so it's in its alpha stage right now, version 0.8.0.

This program will only run on very specific hardware, with even more specific configurations. Right now, my homebrew 8088 computer is the only one it will run on, however I will release the schematics of the hardware soon, so that others will be able to build fully-compatible models.
